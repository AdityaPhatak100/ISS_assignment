What is Normalization?

In simple terms, normalization of storage of data in a simplified form to avoid
data redundancy and prevent occurance of various anomalies (insertion, deletion 
and updation)

The normal form types are:
1NF - must only contain atomic values. There should not be multiple values in
	the same cell.
2NF - non-key attributes are fully function dependent on the primary key. These 
	are stored in a separate table
3NF - partial dependency between non-prime and key attributes must be removed
	and stored in separate tables
4NF - tables separated according to their functional dependencies
5NF - database is broken into as many tables as possible to remove data redundancy
